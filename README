This project was an attempt to use Facebook chat, via a mobile web client hosted on Google's App Engine.

At the time of creation(mid 2008) there was no mobile support for Facebook chat.

While the project isn't complete it does enable the user to login into the system and assess which users are online.

It was mostly a research project and so most the code needs refactoring before being considered for any type of use :)
